# Recent Development Updates ðŸš€

## Concurrent API Implementation âš¡

I successfully implemented concurrent API calls using RxKotlin's Single.zip functionality. Here's what was accomplished:

- Implemented simultaneous execution of two API calls
- Used Single.zip (RxKotlin) for handling separate datasets
- Combined two Single API calls into one concurrent operation
- Added dynamic UI animations for better user experience

### Technical Highlights:
- âœ¨ RxKotlin Implementation
- ðŸ”„ Concurrent API Processing
- ðŸ’« Dynamic UI Animations
